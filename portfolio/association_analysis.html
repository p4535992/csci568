  <h1>Association Analysis</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This section will discuss association analysis. The first section is a description what it is and how associations are commonly built. The second section describes some common uses of associate analysis, as well as some benefits and drawbacks to the classic algorithm.</p>

  <h2>Building Associations</h2>
  <p>Association analysis is just that, an analysis of associations. In english, this means finding interesting relationships or associations between different elements in data. While similar to the goal of finding patterns in data, which is in general the purpose of data mining, association analysis is looking for associations, which are a specific type of pattern. Association analysis uncovers association rules, which define the presence of one item given another. The items that frequently occur together are known as frequent item sets. For example, a store might analyze purchase records to discover what items are frequently bought together. If the store found that beer and diapers are frequently bought together, that would represent a frequent itemset, meaning a set of items that a frequently found together. This itemset would be written as $\{Diapers, Beer\}$. The association rule corresponding to this itemset would say if someone buys diapers, they are likely to also buy beers. The rule can be written more succinctly in the form:</p>
  <div class="equation">
  \(\{Diapers\} \rightarrow \{Beer\}\)
  </div>
