ANN Outline:

Objects:
	Network
		-has layers, in specific order (array, 0 is input, size-1 is output)
		-accepts input -> directs to input layer
			-order is important
		-produces output -> from nodes in output layer
		-has train method, which calls backpropogate method

	Neuron
		-has sigmund function?
		-connects to other neurons, has weights on connections (graph? linked list?)
		-belongs to a layer -> has an order
		-accepts input
		-produces output

	Layer
		-has neurons -> in specific order (array)
		-has a level (input, output, hidden) -> set by order in network array
		-belongs to a network


General procedure:
	-Initialize network with 3 layers (3 neurons, 2 nuerons, 3 nuerons) -> store in an array
		-Randomize weights between neurons with values between -1 and 1
	-Pass input values into network
	-Product output
	-Until output is correct:
		-Train network
		-Produce Output
