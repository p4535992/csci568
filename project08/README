My write-up is in index.html.

The code I used to pre-process the data is in the "code" directory. The results from my association, classification, and clustering are in the "results" directory. This directory also contains the key for my nominal to decimal conversion. Finally, the images folder contains box-plots for my summary statistics and anomaly detection.
